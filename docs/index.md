# Get started

Whether you are creating a new CKAN extension, or you are maintaining existing
one, you're likely want it to follow certain pattern so that external
contributors can easily participate in development.

Additionally, you'd like to use the latest available tools from CKAN to reduce
friction during upgrade. Instead of realizing that extension will be broken
with the next CKAN release and you must do something right now, it always
better to rely on tools that in worst case will get deprecated after the
release, so that you still can afford some level of procrastination and update
the extension when it's convenient for you.

This guide contains collection of quite opinionated recommendations for different
aspects of extension development in CKAN. Some of them may even look
overcomplicated, but if you choose to follow them, in the end you'll have the
complete checklist that can be used for CKAN upgrade. And instead of
smoke-testing the extension praying that no hidden bugs are left after the
upgrade, you'll have a clear list code units that require modification for
every CKAN version upgrade.
